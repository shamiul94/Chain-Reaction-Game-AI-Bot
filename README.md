# Chain-Reaction-Game-AI-Bot
This is a AI bot for Chain Reaction game using minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning ang killer move heuristic.
This implementation is not guaranteed to be accurate. I tried to implement it in a very short time for CSE Fest AI Contest of BUET CSE, 2019. If there is any mistake you find in this code, feel free to create an issue or mail me at ```shamiulhasan93@gmail.com```

This problem is an underrated AI problem. This problem need more attention from CS people. It's quite a hard problem to solve. This heuristic was not completely implemented by me. Help was taken from other net sources.

# THIS CODE IS WRITTEN IN FILE MODE 

Description of my submitted files - 

1. Chainreaction.java is the player code file.

2. my_script.sh is the shell script file to run this file on linux terminal. 

3. Copy these 2 files in the same folder as aicontest.py and shared_file.txt. 

4. Then pass argument to the java file from command line. I used my_script.sh for solely this purpose. Run this script with 
```
      ./my_script.sh
```
